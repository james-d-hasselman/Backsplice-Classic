Backsplice
==========

Backsplice is a software program intended for use in Boy Scout camps that use Doubleknot to register scouts for merit badge courses. Backsplice processes the output from Doubleknot to create rosters for each merit badge course. Instructors can use the rosters to track the progress of each scout throughout the week.
